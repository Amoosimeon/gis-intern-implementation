##Task 4
##Challenge 1
The SQL quary " `SELECT * FROM runners WHERE id NOT IN (SELECT winner_id FROM races) ORDER BY name asc` " will
select from the database all runner whose id is not part of the winner_id in all the races and output it in ascending order

##Challenge 2

The quary selects all the 10 records in the Emp table and 5 records in the Dept table, therefore making it 15
